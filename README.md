# Student-Records

A student records program that gives the user an option to either read information from a file, or to input their own information. 
The user then gets a display menu where they can choose to either display the list of names and grades, 
search the list by name, search the list by grade, sort the list by name, sort the list by grade, or to save information to a file.
The user can then name the file they want to save their info to. This is the client code for IntSorts, StringSorts, Search, and Student classes.
